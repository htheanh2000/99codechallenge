# Issues and Improvements

## 1. Type Safety Issues
- The `blockchain` parameter was typed as `any`.
- Missing proper interface properties (the `blockchain` was used but not defined in the interface).
- Using index as a key in the map function.
- Incomplete Props interface.

## 2. Performance Issues
- Multiple unnecessary iterations over the data (separate filter, sort, and two maps).
- Redundant calculations of USD values.
- Inefficient priority comparison logic.

## 3. Code Structure Issues
- The switch statement for priorities could be replaced with an enum or object.
- Business logic mixed with component logic.
- Inconsistent and unclear variable names (lhs/rhs).
- Unused `children` prop being destructured.

## 4. Logic Issues
- Filter condition was incorrect (returning true for `amount <= 0`).
- Unnecessary nesting in filter condition.
- Inconsistent sorting logic.

## 5. Memory Issues
- Creating new arrays multiple times unnecessarily.
- Creating new row components with inline functions in map.

## 6. Anti-patterns
- Using index as a key for list items.
- Mutating props.
- Not memoizing expensive calculations properly.
